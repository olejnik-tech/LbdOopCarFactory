Project made as a demonstration of OOP for Leon.

Project structure is divided  like this:

1> Static Data (cars.txt, static data)
2> Data processing (FileService)
3> Car Factory (CarService managing Car object from processed data)
4> Car Attribute Factory (Deciding appropriate data type / change for specific car attribute -> called by CarService)
5> UI (Main.java, Console in our case, -> basic runnable project calling CarService)
